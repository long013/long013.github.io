Welcome to my personal website!😊 You can reach me at weitong.long@wur.nl 📧. You can find my [full](assets/Weitong_Long_CV_Full.pdf) and [efficient](assets/Weitong_Long_CV.pdf) Curriculum Vitae here. You can find my Curriculum Vitae in [Chinese](assets/龙维桐_简历.pdf) here. 
For a full list of my publications, please check on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ykye0_QAAAAJ&hl). 

I am Weitong Long (龙维桐). I am currently a [PhD candidate](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/weitong-long) from [Environmental Economics and Natural Resources Group (ENR)](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/environmental-economics-and-natural-resources-group.htm) at [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/) in Wageningen, the Netherlands. I am supervised by Associate Prof. Dr. [Xueqin Zhu](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/xueqin-zhu), Associate Prof. Dr. [Hans-Peter Weikard](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/hans-peter-weikard), Prof. Dr. [Oene Oenema](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/oene-oenema) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/), as well as Prof. Dr. [Yong Hou](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/hy100/list.htm) from [China Agricultural university](https://en.cau.edu.cn/). I conducted one-year research as a visiting PhD student at [China Agricultural university](https://en.cau.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Yong Hou](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/hy100/list.htm) from September 2020 to September 2021. Additionally, I conducted four-month research as a visiting PhD student at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in Davis, the United States, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Dr. [Luis M. Peña-Lévano](https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/luis-m-pena-levano) from October 2024 to January 2025. 

**I am scheduled to submit my PhD thesis in August 2025, with my defense anticipated in December 2025. Currently, I am seeking academic opportunities for the 2025-2026 academic year. I am available for interviews at both the [European Job Market (EJME)](https://www.europeanjobmarketofeconomists.org/) and the [Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA)](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/).**

With over 6+ years of experience as an interdisciplinary quantitative researcher, I specialise in integrated environmental-economic modelling and environmental impact assessment of food systems. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modelling approaches to explore mitigation options towards sustainable food systems. **My PhD dissertation focuses on assessing the impacts of food system transformation options—such as supply-side and demand-side measures, and environmental policies—at the regional, national, and global levels.** I employ an integrated environmental-economic modelling approach based on the general equilibrium framework that is able to represent regional consumption, production, environmental variables, and international trade with other regions. 

I have published 10 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, including two first-authored papers, one published in **Environmental Science & Technology (SCI Q1; IF= 11.3)** and the other in **Sustainable Production and Consumption (SCI & SSCI Q1, IF=9.6)**. In addition, I have a first-authored paper in press at **Nature Food (SCI Q1; IF=21.9)**. 

In my **Job Market Paper** [[Main Text](assets/NF_Main text_clean version.pdf)] [[Supplementary information](assets/NF_Supplementary information_clean version.pdf)] [[Slides](assets/20250207_Food waste slides_Weitong Long.pdf)], currently in principle accepted in **Nature Food**, I highlight that rebound effects may undermine benefits of upcycling food waste and food processing by-products as animal feed in China and have significant knock-on effects beyond the agricultural sectors, thereby influencing sectoral employment, gross domestic product, and household welfare. Implementing appropriate emission taxes provides an opportunity to absorb the rebound effects on emissions but may negatively affect food security indicators and shift emission-intensive sectors from China to its trading partners, depending on the height of the taxes.
