Welcome to my personal website!

I am a [PhD candidate](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/weitong-long) from [Environmental Economics and Natural Resources Group (ENR) group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/environmental-economics-and-natural-resources-group.htm) in [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/). I am supervised by Associate Prof. Dr. [Xueqin Zhu](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/xueqin-zhu), Associate Prof. Dr. [Hans-Peter Weikard](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/hans-peter-weikard), Prof. Dr. [Oene Oenema](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/oene-oenema) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/), as well as Prof. Dr. [Yong Hou](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/hy100/list.htm) from [China Agricultural university](https://en.cau.edu.cn/). I will be conducting research as a visiting PhD student at [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) under the supervision of Assistant Professor Dr. [Luis M. Pe√±a-L√©vano](https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/luis-m-pena-levano) from October 2024 to January 2025. 

**I am scheduled to submit my PhD thesis in June 2025, with my defense anticipated in September 2025. Currently, I am seeking academic opportunities for the 2024-2025 academic year. I am available for interviews at both the [European Job Market (EJME)](https://www.europeanjobmarketofeconomists.org/) and the [Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA)](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/).**

With over 6+ years of experience as a Quantitative researcher and economist, I specialise in integrated environmental-economic modelling and environmental impact assessment. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modelling approaches to explore mitigation options towards sustainable food systems. **My PhD dissertation focuses on assessing the impacts of food system transformation pathways‚Äîsuch as supply-side and demand-side measures, and environmental policies‚Äîat the regional, national, and global levels.** I employ an integrated environmental-economic modelling approach based on a computable general equilibrium framework that is able to represent regional consumption, production, environmental variables, and international trade with other regions. 

I have published 10 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, including two first-authored papers, one published in **Environmental Science & Technology (SCI Q1; IF= 10.8)** and the other in **Sustainable Production and Consumption (SCI & SSCI Q1, IF=10.9)**, along with a co-authored paper published in **Nature Food (SCI Q1; IF=23.6)**. For a full list of my publications, please check on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ykye0_QAAAAJ&hl).

In my **Job Market Paper** [[Main Text](assets/20241012_Food waste paper_Weitong Long.pdf)] [[Supplementary information](assets/20241012_Supplementary information_Food waste paper_Weitong Long.pdf)] [[Slides](assets/20240703_Food waste slides_Weitong Long.pdf)], I highlighted that rebound effects may undermine benefits of upcycling low-opportunity-cost feed as animal feed in China, and a modest mitigation target could address these rebound effects in China while safeguarding global food security.
