Welcome to my personal website!

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate from [Environmental Economics and Natural Resources Group (ENR) group](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/social-sciences/environmental-economics-and-natural-resources-group.htm) in [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/). **My research interests include integrated environmental-economic modelling, sustainable food provision, food-land-water-climate nexus, and environmental impact assessment of the food chain**. I am supervised by Associate Prof. Dr. [Xueqin Zhu](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/xueqin-zhu), Associate Prof. Dr. [Hans-Peter Weikard](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/hans-peter-weikard), Prof. Dr. [Oene Oenema](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/oene-oenema) from [Wageningen University & Research](https://www.wur.nl/), as well as Prof. Dr. [Yong Hou](https://faculty.cau.edu.cn/hy100/list.htm) from [China Agricultural university](https://en.cau.edu.cn/). I will be conducting research as a visiting PhD student at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. [Luis M. Pe√±a-L√©vano](https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/luis-m-pena-levano) from October 2024 to January 2025. 

With over 6+ years of experience as a researcher and economist, I specialise in integrated environmental-economic modelling and impact assessment. My expertise lies in applying quantitative modelling approaches to explore mitigation pathways for sustainable food systems. **My PhD dissertation focuses on assessing the impacts of food system transformation pathways‚Äîsuch as supply-side and demand-side measures, and environmental policies‚Äîat the regional, national, and global levels.** I employ an integrated environmental-economic modelling approach based on a computable general equilibrium framework that is able to represent regional consumption, production, environmental variables, and international trade with other regions. I have published 9 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, including one first-authored paper published in **Environmental Science & Technology (JCR: Q1; IF= 11.4)** and one co-authored paper published in **Nature Food (JCR: Q1; IF=23.2)**.

**I am expected to receive my PhD in September 2025. Currently, I am seeking academic opportunities for the 2024-2025 academic year. I am available for interviews at both the European Job Market (EJME) and the Allied Social Science Associations (ASSA).**
